##### 3.    Brief information
My dream job is **creating nice and multifunctional web-applications** that will grab people's attention and will improve the industry. I would like to contribute to the development of resources for medical professionals and scientists, as well as to the creation of sites that make people’s lives easier and make them happy.

**My strong points** is ability to stay calm in any situation. Also, I’m a fast learner and excellent at finding any information. In addition, I have  a soft-skills and communicate well with a team.

I have no work experience yet and I **continue my studies** in college. I'm that type of student who have been looking for area of interest for a long time, in order to completely immerse myself in it. Now I have come to the conclusion that the web-development is what I was looking for.

##### 4.    Skills

Basic knowledge of:
- C++, C#
-	JavaScript, Java
- HTML5, CSS, PHP, SQL
    
During my studies in college, I studied both **functional programming methodology** and **OOP** and also applied my knowledge in practice and my projects.

##### 5.    Сode example 

```javascript 
function getRandomInt(min, max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min)) + min;
                                }
  
  let input, output,key;
  let inp, k;
  
  input = prompt("Введите исходный текст");
  key = prompt("Введите ключ");
  
  if ((key.length) < (input.length)) {
      alert("Данный ключ короче сообщения. Скопируйте новый сгенерированный ключ из консоли.");
      key = "";
  
      for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
          key += String.fromCharCode(getRandomInt(0,66535));
                                             }
                                             
      console.log("Скопируйте сгенерированный ключ");
      console.log(key);
                                    }	
  
  output = "";
  for (i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
      inp = input.charCodeAt(i);
      k = key.charCodeAt(i);
      output += String.fromCharCode(inp ^ k); 
                                    }
  
  console.log("Результат шифрования данных в режиме однократного гаммирования");
  console.log(output);
  ```


##### 6.	Work experience
During my studies, I worked on various projects such as:
+ creating small console applications in C ++, C# and Java;
+ creating applications with the simplest graphic design that can solve mathematical problems;
+  creating JavaFX applications for educational purposes (test systems and reporting student progress).

 Also, while I was working on a course project, developed a CRUD-application for changes in the database containing information about heating equipment.
The last project I worked on was an [Encryptor](https://github.com/SPbCT-LobanovaAnna/SPbCT-LobanovaAnnaYurevna) written in JavaScript.

##### 7.	Education
This summer I am graduating from St. Petersburg College of Telecommunications with a degree in Programming Technician.
